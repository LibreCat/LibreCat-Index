LibreCat-Index

 Catmandu style indexation of MARC sequential files into (multicore) Solr indexes.

Installation:

 Copy the LibreCat-Index directory to your favorite local application directory: e.g. /usr/local or /opt

Configuration:

 catmandu.yml - defines the Solr cores available on your system and default fixes
 lib/Catmandu/Fix/meercat.pm - mapping of MARC fields to Solr fields
 lib/Catmandu/Fix/holding.pm - used at UGent to parse journal holding messages into a general holdings statement (e.g. journal X available from 1920 to 2000)
 multicore - configuration and data directory for Solr cores

Usage:

  See the bin directory for indexation scripts

  meercat_index.pl - used to index MARC (Aleph sequential ..configurable see Catmandu::MARC) files

  # (re)index the rug01 export file
  ./meercat_index.pl -v --clear rug01 /vol/indexes/incoming/rug01.export
  
  # update Solr with rug01 records
  ./meercat_index.pl -v rug01 /vol/indexes/incoming/rug01.updates

  # delete Solr with rug01 records
  ./meercat_index.pl -v --delete rug01 /vol/indexes/incoming/rug01.deletes


  meercat_search.pl - command line interface to search the Solr index

  # execute a search
  ./meercat_search.pl dna

 
  marcxml_aleph.pl - convert a MARCXML file into Aleph sequential

  
  meercat - init.d script to stop/start a Solr daemon. The scripts reads it parameters from the SOLR environment variables or a /etc/sysconfig/meercat bash file

  SOLR_DIR=Installation directory of Solr (the directory containing the start.jar file)
  SOLR_HOME=Configuration directory of Solr (the directory containing the solr.xml file .. use the multicore directory in our example)
  SOLR_LOG=Solr error log file
  SOLR_START_PORT=Solr start port (default 8983)
  SOLR_STOP_PORT=Solr stop port (default 8079)
  SOLR_MEMORY=Solr allocated memory (default 2048m)
